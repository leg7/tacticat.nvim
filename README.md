My personal neovim color theme/scheme.

Most colorschemes I've come across were built with no regard for code
readability. They feature way too many colors, all with poor contrast scores,
making reading code harder than if you had no syntax highlighting to begin
with.

This theme is designed to help you navigate source code faster and more
efficiently thanks to color. I've kept the color palette as small as possible
to keep the syntactic meaning of the highlighting clear and understandable at a
glance.
Foreground colors were also chosen to have good contrast scores with their
background colors to ensure readability.

This theme was loosely inspired by the `tacticat` counter-strike skin for the CZ75-auto sidearm.

Dark theme coming soon.
Screenshots coming soon.
